## Spark Volatility Forensics Framework

The Spark Volatility Forensics Framework aims to provide an easy way to run volatility on a Spark cluster.

Hopefully, this will allow forensic analysts to run multiple memory dumps through different Volatility modules and get results much faster by leveraging Spark's parallel processing power.

### Dependencies:
- CDH5+

- Python 2.6+

- mrjob - Python library for Hadoop

- Volatility Framework 2.4 - The Volatility Memory Forensics Framework
