Big Data Security Analytics

## Overview
This project aims to provide security professionals with the tools needed to ingest and analyze large amounts of security data by leveraging Apache Spark, HDFS and other Hadoop ecosystem components.

A web user interface is included. It uses Flask and spawns Spark jobs in the backend to generate JSON results based on user input.

No stable release yet but i am working towards a fully working alpha version in the next few months.
